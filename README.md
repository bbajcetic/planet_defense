## Planet Defense:

Planet Defense is a simple arcade type game (my first game) written in C++ that uses openGL for its graphics API and GLFW for window creation and event processing (utilities). Motivated by the Phoenix arcade game, you control a space ship that destroys enemy space ships and you accumulate a score. The goal of this game is to score the highest score possible before one of two things happen: 1) You die or 2) The Earth that you are trying to save explodes.

Progress:
So far, the state of the game contains a main ship that you control and enemy ships that spawn just often enough to make the game tougher the longer you stay alive. You can shoot down the enemy ships with enough shots, and for each one that you destroy, you score 10 points, and once you run out of health, the game will end and you can see your score!
