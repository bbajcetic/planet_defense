## Planet Defense:

Planet Defense is a very simple game (my first game) written in C++ that uses openGL for its graphics API. Motivated by the Phoenix arcade game, you control a space ship that destroys enemy space ships. The goal of this game is to score the highest score possible before one of two things happen: either you die or the Earth that you are trying to save explodes.
