## Planet Defense:

Planet Defense is a simple arcade type game (my first game) written in C++ that uses openGL for its graphics API and GLFW for window creation and event processing (utilities). Motivated by the Phoenix arcade game, you control a space ship that destroys enemy space ships and you accumulate a score. The goal of this game is to score the highest score possible before one of two things happen: 1) You die or 2) The Earth that you are trying to save explodes.
